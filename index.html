    <p>Hi, I am Dr Niall Newsham, a postdoc at the <a href="https://move.geog.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">MOVE research lab</a> within <a href="https://www.ucsb.edu/" target="_blank">UC Santa Barbara.</a> I am population geographer interested in understanding contemporary demographic change across space and between places. My research intersects demography and geography, and explores themes such as population decline, low fertility, migration flows and mobility trajectories. I hold a Ph.D. in Human Geography, and an M.Sc. in Demography and Population Studies from the University of Liverpool, UK. I have also spent time as a visiting scholar at the Max Planck institute of Demography Research in Rostock, Germany, Centro de Estudios Demogr√°ficos, Barcelona, Spain, and the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago, USA. Here you can keep up to date with my research with access to my journal articles, code, and courses. </p>
