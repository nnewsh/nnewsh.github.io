This website hosts the materials for the demonstration “Using Long-Short Term Memory Models to Forecast Population in R”. The materials here were prepared by Dr Niall Newsham for demonstration at El Colegio De Mexico in June 2024. The code demonstrated here is derived from _Newsham, N., Kumar, P., Cabrera-Arnau, C,. Rowe, F., 2024. A Long Short-Term Memory Forecast of sub-National Population Change Across Europe_, available [here](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9azqy). 

##Introduction 
This course demonstrates the capabilities of Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for time series forecasting in R. It provides a framework to build and implement an LSTM model for a specific use case in population forecasting, though its principles can be applied in other time series prediction. LSTMs possess an advanced abilty, through deep learning architectures, to understand complex temporal dependencies in longitudinal data. In real-life applications, they power predictive text AI technologies, or financial forecast models. Their ability to process and remember relevant information in an input sequence of data makes them well-suited for predictive functions. including population forecasting. Already, studies have demonstrated their potential in predicting population outcomes (Riiman 2019, Wang & Lee 2021, Grossman 2023), highlighting more accurate estimates that traditional approaches under certain model configurations. 

This course describes the process of building and implementing a population forecast using LSTM machine learning models.
The LSTM model produces a one year ahead forecast of population size, using data from the [WorldPop](https://hub.worldpop.org/geodata/listing?id=75) organisation (Stevens et al., 2015). The input data consists of a time series of annual population values (2000 - 2019) for a total of 9,054 municipalities of the UK. The LSTM is designed to learn of temporal dependencies in this full set of input data, and consider it in predictions of population size in 2020 for individual areas.
